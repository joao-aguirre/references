form) are readily available in the open literature for commonly encountered
geometries. For more complex three-dimensional (3D) scenarios, however, the
effort required to solve the requisite multi-dimensional integrations needed to
estimate a required view factor can be daunting to say the least. In such cases,
a combination of finite element methods (where the geometry in question is
sub-divided into a large number of uniform, often triangular, elements) and
Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MC-RT) has been developed, although frequently the
software implementation is suitable only for a limited set of geometrical
scenarios. Driven initially by a need to calculate the radiative heat transfer
occurring within an operational fibre-drawing furnace, this research set out to
examine options whereby MC-RT could be used to cost-effectively calculate any
generic 3D radiative view factor using current vectorisation technologies.},

formulação de condução de calor melhorada para partículas esféricas. As
partículas são tratadas como uma fase discreta, seguindo a abordagem DEM,
enquanto o fluido é tratado como uma fase contínua, descrito pelas equações de
Navier-Stokes promediadas no volume da célula. Em vez de aproximar a temperatura
da superfície pela temperatura média da partícula como na abordagem de
parâmetros concentrados clássica, desenvolveu-se um modelo aprimorado que
relaciona a temperatura média da partícula com a temperatura e o fluxo de calor
na superfície usando aproximações do tipo Hermite para integrais. Casos simples
foram utilizados para validar a metodologia de acoplamento proposta. O método
foi então aplicado à simulação de um leito fluidizado borbulhante do tipo
Geldart D. Os resultados obtidos foram comparados com dados experimentais de
pressão e velocidade, mostrando boa concordância. Os resultados de temperatura
mostram que a suposição da temperatura uniforme pode influenciar o cálculo da
transferência de calor entre as partículas e, portanto, prever temperaturas
menores do que as reais no leito.}

traditional Monte Carlo Ray Tracing method on the hardware used and obtaining a
maximum relative error of 0.39% for configurations evaluated in the literature.
Furthermore, a calculation methodology for view factors between

concept, is presented and applied on a set of randomly assembled monosized
packed beds generated with the LIGGGHTS software, covering an average porosity
range from 0.38 to 0.50 for the arrays. Finally, detailed analysis and
discussion of the results are performed, allowing to find characteristic view

factors particle-wall and particle-lid which is defined as layer view factor
method, considering error intervals for each interaction respectively, defining
a view factor calculation methodology for packed beds within the studied

heat transfer are simulated for all particles via discrete element modeling

friction coefficients, and thermal contact resistances are parametrically
varied. Decreasing the inclination angle increases the residence time and
overall heat transfer coefficient. Low values of the friction coefficients slow
the particles and increase heating, but moderate to high values of friction
dilute the flow and decrease the heat transfer. The contact resistance between
particles is difficult to accurately characterize, so a wide range is studied.
The contact resistance is altered by varying the particle roughness from 27.5 nm
to 1 um, which reduces the overall heat transfer coefficient by 25%. A reduced
order model is developed and validated to extrapolate the small-scale DEM
results to a larger-scale system.}

abstract = {This paper proposes an effective general numerical procedure for the
accurate evaluation of the geometric view factors between equally sized spheres
in a randomly packed assembly. The procedure is a novel combination of three key
techniques: the Tanaka integral expression for the view factor between two equal
spheres, the product form of the Fibonacci integration scheme for integrals on
spheres, and the non-uniform variable scaling. The Tanaka integral not only
provides a simple integral to numerically compute the exact value of the view
factor between two unit spheres without a blockage, but also plays a fundamental
role in improving the computed shaded view factor between two spheres subject to
any blockage. The product Fibonacci integration scheme, essentially a
ray-tracing method, appears to be a low cost but sufficiently accurate cubature
for evaluating the dual-integral defining the view factor. The use of a
particular non-uniform scaling function very favourably modulates the properties
of the view factor integrals, and thus substantially improves the solution
accuracy of the Fibonacci integration scheme. Several practical issues
associated with the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are discussed, and
test cases are provided to illustrate the applicability of the procedure.}

These phenomena include (i) shadowing, (ii) emission and (iii) adsorption by a
constant gray medium. After careful verification, we embed our algorithm in
LIGGGHTS, a solver for the DEM. A combination of LIGGGHTS and a solver for
intra-particle temperature gradients, i.e., ParScale, is then used to quantify
the relevance of radiative heat transfer rates in sheared particles beds.
Specifically, we evaluate the relative contributions of conductive, convective
and radiative thermal fluxes in granular shear flows of frictional inelastic
spheres. We find that the radiative flux can be collapsed onto single curve if
it is related to an appropriate dimensionless group. Our analysis establishes a
rationale on when radiative heat transfer in dense granular flows should be
considered or not. Also, our results can be used to close continuum-based
granular dynamics model that aim on predicting the particle temperature

relevant for industrial applications. Nowadays computational techniques, e.g.
the discrete element method (DEM), are frequently applied as a tool to probe the
behavior of granular systems. The DEM is a particularly attractive modelling
technique since it can provide both macroscopic and microscopic ‘measurements’
in granular systems and allows particles of non-spherical shape to be modelled.
This ability is important since there is a common understanding that particle
shape has a strong influence on the dynamics of these systems. Here, we
critically review recent developments in DEM to model particles of non-spherical
shape. The first section of the review is concerned with advances in the
formulation and implementation of non-spherical particle models, including shape
representation, algorithms for the efficient detection of contacts and the
determination of contact parameters. In the second part, we review the main
findings obtained from numerical ‘measurements’ in granular systems containing
non-spherical particles using the DEM. The systems covered in this review
include the packing of particles, particle flow (e.g. plane shear flow, the
discharge of particles from hoppers and particle motion in vibrated beds and
rotating cylinders) and two-phase particle flows such as gas–solid fluidized
beds and pneumatic conveying. We conclude with an outlook highlighting the

abstract = {Over the past decade, DEM-based simulation has become a promising
alternative to physical measurements of thermal particulate systems. Despite
their rapid advancement and successful applications to a wide range of
industrial processes, a comprehensive review of the theory that underpins the
thermal DEM-based simulations is yet to be conducted. This work presents a
critical and in-depth review of all major thermal models and heat transfer
mechanisms pertinent to DEM-based simulations. Other critical aspects such as
boundary conditions and particle body temperature distribution that were often
overlooked are also summarized and discussed, aiming to provide a clear path for
the development of robust thermal DEM-based models.

The quasi-analytical solution based on the Hertzian contact theory proves
classic and remains the main method to solving the conduction of static
contacts. Recent attempts have been mainly directed towards improving the
calculation of conduction through collisional contacts and the thin wedge of
interstitial fluid between particles. Empirical correlations that were developed
before 1981 remain predominant in calculating the fluid-particle convection
coefficient. Though more accurate, the discrete models of radiation that rely on
the solution of view factors amongst individual particles have been applied much
less than the continuum models due to the significant computational overhead.
Generally, previous efforts have led to the construction of a solid framework of
thermal DEM-based models. Significant work is required to improve existing or
develop new heat transfer sub-models, particularly those for accurate and
efficient modelling of conduction and radiation in particle-laden systems.}

converts carbonaceous materials, such as coal, petroleum, petroleum coke, or
biomass, into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Coal gasification as a
power-generation technology is gaining popularity due to the ready global
availability of the raw material (coal), as well as positive environmental
issues associated with this technology over other combustion technologies. To
ensure optimal process efficiency, an in-depth understanding of the coal
properties influencing gasification behavior is required. Gasification
performance is dependent on coal type and gasifier configuration. Typically,
gasifiers are classified according to the type of reactor used and the way in
which fuels and oxidant flow. The choice of gasification technology is dependent
on a variety of factors, but coal type is generally the least flexible factor
and gasification technology selection is typically based on the coal to be
processed.},

examine heat conduction through static, two-dimensional beds of granular
materials. Results of both experiments and a microstructurally based continuum
model compare well with those obtained from TPD simulation. The TPD technique,
therefore, may provide a unique test-bed for validating or extending theories of
effective properties in granular media by yielding detailed mechanical and
thermal information not easily measured in experiments. Moreover, in testing
this technique it is found that, at low compressive loads or in high aspect
ratio beds, the conductivity of particulate materials becomes highly
anisotropic. This suggests that it is possible to dynamically tune the granular
microstructure and hence the bed's properties.},

mineral processing industry and other industries where size reduction of rocks
is a key focus. With the need for more accurate and sophisticated models, the
introduction of computational models like the discrete element method (DEM) has
started to solve some of the complex problems in comminution. This review
article provides a general, though not exhaustive, overview of the application
of computational techniques to the science of comminution. Over the last two
decades the DEM has become an important tool for understanding comminution
fundamentals and providing information for the design, optimisation and
operation of comminution devices. Over that time, the application of DEM in
simulating fracture, breakage, crushing, milling and equipment wear has
increased in size and complexity. Information from DEM has contributed to
modelling techniques like, mechanistic modelling, the Unified Comminution Model
and the Virtual Comminution Machine. These have enabled step changes in
understanding of comminution processes. DEM is now widely used in industries
where comminution is critical. Important challenges remain for the next decade
including representation of unresolved fine material: prediction of its
influence on the overall processes and its size reduction. Similarly, slurry
phase transport and rheology have barely been touched on in using computational
techniques in comminution modelling. Most importantly in the future is the
uptake of the DEM outputs into standard comminution models used in design and
optimisation of equipment and processes, as despite the progress made in
understanding and in quantitative outputs the barriers to routine uptake have
not been surmounted.}

abstract = {The theoretical description of fuel conversion processes and the
numerical simulation of the equipment employed has gained considerable
industrial application throughout the last two decades. Starting from the
combustion of gaseous fuel in homogeneous turbulent flows, a basically
continuous, Eulerian fluid, the further development lead to the Lagrangian
description of droplets or pulverized solid fuel particles by independently
tracking there movement and conversion within the fluid and neglecting
collisions. Current developments in the energy sector require the consideration
of much larger particles which can no longer be considered as non-colliding
material points. Municipal waste incineration on grates [1], directly or
indirectly heated rotary kilns [2] or wood pellet combustion in domestic boilers
are such examples, where the Discrete Element Method (DEM) extends the
Lagrangian description to a mechanically and thermally fully interacting flow of
reacting granular material. In some situations with sufficiently large scale
differences distinctive interfaces can be identified between the conventional
CFD-description and the solid bed, thus allowing a separate and different
treatment of radiation in both regions. In other applications like in shaft
kilns, the radiative transfer within the moving bed enhances the effective
conductivity of the porous medium. Available commercial CFD-Codes provide
several different radiation models suitable for grey or non-grey media enclosed
by walls. They range from approaches fully neglecting interaction with the
enclosed gas phase (S2S), models describing the radiative transfer solely as a
diffusive process (P-1), directionally discretised radiative transport equations
as in the Discrete Ordinates (DO) method up to techniques explicitly relying on
rays passing through the participating media (Discrete Transfer, DTRM). The
integration of any of these radiation models into a coupled CFD-DEM code
represents a challenge and is even more complex if a distinctive separating
surface does not exist. In the work presented, the significance of using
adequate modelling of the radiative fluxes onto the surface of reacting granular
media will be discussed in the context of two technical relevant examples, the
waste conversion on reciprocating grates in municipal waste incinerators and
heat the exchange with the moving material surface in rotating kilns. The
restrictions and pitfalls in modifications of the boundary conditions for the
different radiation models will be discussed and compared with each other.}

transport devices, such as pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled nuclear
reactors (HTGR). The effect of particle thermal radiation in packed pebble beds
has been rarely investigated at particle scale. In this work, a complete CFD-DEM
method coupled with particle-scale radiation is discussed for packed pebble
beds, considering particle motion, fluid flow, particle-fluid interactions and
heat convection, conduction and particle radiation. It is shown that, compared
to the case without particle radiation, heat transfer is enhanced greatly by
particle radiation at high temperatures. A particle radiation factor (PRF) is
proposed as an independent non-dimensional parameter to qualify the effect of
particle-scale radiation in packed pebble beds. The PRF increases significantly
with temperature and decreases gradually as the heat storage capacity or the
thermal conductivity of the fluid increases. A demonstrative utilization of the
present model is performed for a benchmark problem based on the HTR-10 nuclear
reactor, and the results in general are in agreement with the results predicted
by other empirical codes. When the nuclear reactor is above full power, the
power required by the fan will increase significantly. In the decay heat removal
process, particle radiation is essential to keep the bed temperature below the
allowable limit, which is significant for nuclear reactor safety.}

interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the
relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular

macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions
between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids.
Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is
therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate
matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be
effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic
information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual
particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been
rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of
discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper
reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element
method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important
aspects: models for the calculation of the particle–particle and particle–fluid
interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid
dynamics to describe particle–fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete

In this paper we focus on particle flows in which the particles have no liquid films and report on an improved expression we have developed for the collision damping time of particle velocity fluctuations used in the BGK approximation. The improved expression includes the effects on the collision damping time of the particle material coefficient of restitution and of non-equilibrium particle velocity distributions. The collision model improvements are incorporated into the general-purpose computational-particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) numerical methodology for dense particle flows. Three computational examples show the benefits of using the new collision time in calculations of particle separation in polydisperse dense particle flows and calculations of colliding particle jets.},

This guarantees convergence to a DEM-based simulation of the unscaled system, i.e., a system where
all the individual particles are tracked. We use a BGK-like relaxation term to model collisions between particles in dilute regions of the flow field. This combined approach is implemented in an in-house code that runs on GPUs (Radeke et al., 2010), and is used to study a granular jet impinging on a plane surface, as well as a simple shear flow.

This algorithm works by searching a point in the feasible region which is defined by a set of plane equations of enclosure boundaries that maximize the line equation of the emitted energy bundle as the objective function. This algorithm is examined for two benchmark problems, namely two parallel plates with gray specular surfaces and a box with gray diffuse walls both in three-dimensional case. Although the computation time of the new proposed method is a bit higher than the conventional time, it is easy to implement because simplex algorithm is readily available as separate module in most programming languages.

abstract = {The modeling of radiative heat transfer in complex radiant enclosures is a particularly challenging subject. This simulation is often best treated by calculating distribution factors through the Monte Carlo method. In order to enhance performance of the Monte Carlo method, efficient algorithms to find location of emission and direction of emission in the original Monte Carlo method are implemented. Next, the best ray tracing algorithm is introduced by comparing timing results of the USD, the BSP, the Simplex and the VVA acceleration ray tracing algorithms to make it numerically efficient as possible. Also, the constrained maximum likelihood estimation is used to enhance accuracy of the Monte Carlo by smoothing inherent random errors in the estimated distribution factors to simultaneously satisfy both of the reciprocity and summation rules. Accuracy of the Monte Carlo method is tested for a classical problem, namely a 3D box, with diffuse gray walls. For efficiency study, the optimized Monte Carlo method is then tested for two real radiative enclosures with convex and concave geometries. All ray tracing algorithms are found to result in computational gains, with respect to direct calculations that do not employ any acceleration technique. In the considered test cases, the VVA and the USD algorithms are found to be clearly superior to the BSP and the Simplex algorithms, particularly for concave geometries that have some obstructions within the computational domain.},

abstract = {In CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method) simulations particles are considered Lagrangian point particles. The details of the flow near the particle surface are therefore not fully resolved. When the particle scale is larger than the resolved flow scale, the coupling between the CFD model and the DEM model is critical. An effective coupling scheme should minimize the risk of artificial influences on the results from choices of numerical parameters in implementations and consider efficiency and robustness. In this work, a novel coupling method is developed. The method includes both the smoothing of the particle data and the sampling of the gas phase quantities. The smoothing employs the diffusion-based method. The gas sampling method can reconstruct the filtered fluid quantities at the particle center. The sampling method is developed based on the diffusion-based method with higher efficiency. The new method avoids mesh searching and it can be easily implemented in parallel computing. The developed method is validated by the simulation of a forced convection experiment for a fixed bed with steel spheres. With the well-posed grid-independent coupling scheme, the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The coupling effects and the computational cost are discussed in detail.},

Simulations were performed with a coupled DEM–CFD approach, which involves a drag force model that realizes for the particle shape and orientation. To validate the drag force model and to learn more about the fluidization behavior of non-spherical particles the pressure drop, particle height and orientation distributions were analyzed. To gain comparable data from the experiments, a PTV-MATLAB script was developed to detect particles and determine their orientations and heights. Experimental and numerical results are in good agreement for most particle types; differences in the pressure drop can be allocated to mismatching particle heights or orientations. Differences in the particle height distribution are a result of particles that stack up in corners or close to the vessel walls. It was found that despite these local deviations the DEM–CFD can accurately reproduce the orientation behavior of elongated particles, which with increasing velocity align themselves with the flow. For elongated particles below a certain elongation ratio this behavior could not be observed, which was confirmed by both experiments and simulations.},

There is also a critical cell size (1/19.3 domain size) below which meso-scale flow structures are resolved.

abstract = {Understanding the details of the mixing and stoking process on grate firing systems is crucial for the optimization of the combustion process in waste or biomass incineration plants. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) can help to obtain further information on the mixing process within a bed of fuel particles. Especially the influence of a change in operational parameters can be examined avoiding large experimental effort. In the current paper five simulations for a generic grate are compared with the corresponding experiments. The experiments were carried out throughout an anterior parameter study on mixing and stoking on a grate [Sudbrock F.; Simsek E.; Wirtz S.; Scherer V.: “An experimental analysis of the influence of operational parameters on mixing and stoking of a monodisperse granulate on a grate”, Powder Technology 198, Issue 1, 29–37, 2010] [19]. The system considered is equipped with vertically moving bars which induce stoking. In a first approach monodisperse plastic spheres are used. The grate is encased by a transparent polycarbonate housing which provides optical access to the movement of the particles in the wall planes. The mixing process is measured and quantified by image analysis of the front wall of the grate. The mixing behaviour of the particle assembly observed in experiments and simulation appears to be very similar indicating that DEM is able to predict the particle mixing in the bed. In order to quantify the visual observations the mixing behaviour has been evaluated by different mixing parameters. They are compared in dependence of the number of strokes of the grate bars. A good agreement between measurements and simulations could be observed.},

Unlike most previous studies, the method does not rely on the assumption of a unit cell or absorption and scattering coefficients to derive k_rad . In this method, radiation is modeled with a 3D Monte Carlo ray tracing code, steady state particle temperatures are found with a particle-particle heat exchange simulation, and k_rad is found with a comparison to heat conduction in an isotropic solid of the same geometry. This leads to the dimensionless Exchange Factor (F_E), allowing k_rad to be calculated at any temperature and particle radius. The key result is a model for F_E over the entire range of emissivities from 0.3 to 1 and solid fractions from 0.25 to the fully packed state of 0.64. F_E results are compared to previous models, with agreement shown in some cases but a large disagreement found for low solid fractions. The k_rad results are combined with the Zehner and Schlünder model for solid and fluid conduction, providing an equation for the full effective thermal conductivity.},

abstract = {The calculation of radiative heat transfer between particles in particle-based solar systems presents significant challenges in terms of computational cost and accuracy. This study addresses these challenges by employing the discrete element method to generate random particle packings and the Monte Carlo ray tracing method to investigate the influence of particle shape and volume fraction ($\phi$) on interparticle radiation transfer and the absorption of incident radiation. The results reveal that, at low volume fractions, the shape and orientation of ellipsoidal particles have a pronounced impact on direct radiative transfer. Oblate particles exhibit the highest average radiation distribution factor (RDF), and the dispersion of RDF data is more prominent for oblate and elongated prolate particles compared to spheres. As $\phi$ increases to 0.35, the contribution of indirect transfer from neighboring particles becomes significant for oblate particles, resulting in a reduction in the dispersion of RDF data. Furthermore, when $\phi$ reaches 0.55, the decisive factor in determining RDF becomes the shielding effect of particles positioned between the emitting and receiving particles. The average RDF tends to converge among particles of different shapes, although oblate and elongated prolate particles still exhibit considerably larger RDF dispersion compared to spherical and near-spherical particles. Additionally, the effective absorptivity of the particle bed for incident radiation decreases as the aspect ratio of particles increases at all volume fractions. Moreover, the transmitted fraction demonstrates an exponential relationship with the depth, and beds composed of spherical particles exhibit better radiation transmittance compared to beds containing non-spherical particles.},

The current study is focused on concentrating solar power receivers which use solid particles as a heat transfer medium, but results are applicable to particle beds in various industries. The analyses are carried out using a purpose-built open-source Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code for beam radiation striking a group of particles. Particle beds with a uniform solid fraction and diffuse reflections are studied first, with the total bed absorptivity found for various combinations of the incidence angle, absorptivity, and solid fraction, culminating in an expression for the total bed absorptivity as a function of these independent variables. In addition, the transmitted fraction of incident rays as a function of distance into the bed is given in table format for many sets of these parameters. These results form the foundation of an algorithm developed to estimate the radiation absorption at different depths in the more challenging case where the solid fraction varies as a function of depth in the bed. This is particularly important for the “CentRec” solar receiver, where the solid fraction oscillates due to the thin particle film used in this device (only 4–10 particle diameters thick), as well as the dynamic nature of the particle film. The algorithm is implemented in a Discrete Element Method model for heat transfer in the CentRec receiver, and the algorithm is shown to have a high accuracy with a very low computational cost compared to a full Monte Carlo Ray Tracing simulation.},

This is useful in Monte Carlo rendering techniques, such as path tracing, where directions are usually sampled in spherical coordinates and then transformed to a Cartesian unit vector in a local coordinate system where the zenith direction is the z-axis. The second tool is a more general result extracted from the first formula, namely a faster way of building an orthonormal basis from a 3D unit vector. These tools require fewer arithmetic operations than other methods I am aware of, and a performance test of the more general tool confirms that it is faster.},

abstract = {Multi-phase flows in the presence of complex solid geometries are encountered widely throughout industrial processes to intensify mass and heat transfer processes. The efficiency of these processes relies largely on the predominant fluid dynamics regime inside the reaction vessel (e.g. trickle bed, bubble column reactor). The prevailing flow structure is influenced by many factors including the nature of the fluid-solid interactions (i.e. wetting or non-wetting). Such flows are often studied using front-capturing techniques to capture the fluid-fluid interface in combination with an auxiliary model to account for fluid-solid interactions. However, these front-capturing methods have difficulties in accurately representing the interface. Therefore, we adopted a front-tracking method: the Local Front Reconstruction Method (LFRM). In this study, LFRM is coupled with the Immersed Boundary method to incorporate the no-slip boundary condition at the solid surface. The model performance is assessed using droplet spreading simulations, where the equilibrium droplet shape (i.e. radius, height, and outline), the interfacial pressure difference, and the surface tension force are compared to analytical solutions and literature data. The results show an excellent match with the analytical solutions, and additionally superior performance to state-of-the-art volume tracking models.},

However, challenges arise from conflicting requirements regarding the CFD grid size, which must adequately resolve fluid flow in the pore space while maintaining a physically meaningful porosity field. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a two-grid mapping approach. Initially, the porosity field associated with fine particles is estimated using a coarse CFD grid, which is then mapped to a dynamically refined grid. To ensure conservation of total solid volume, a volume compensation procedure is implemented. The proposed method has been rigorously verified using benchmark cases, showing its high computational efficiency and accurate handling of complex porosity calculations near the surface of coarse particles. Moreover, the previously unreported impact of the empirical drag correlation on fluid-particle force calculations for both coarse and fine particles has been revealed.},

abstract = {Unstructured packings consisting of arbitrary shaped particles are widely used in chemical, biochemical and petrochemical industries as well as in energy technology. In packings passed through by a fluid, pressure drops are of key concern and can be derived experimentally, calculated by empirical correlations or by numerical approaches. Among numerical approaches either resolved flow simulations or porous approaches are feasible. In the latter approach large systems can be addressed at reasonable computational expense. The fluid velocity is addressed as a spatially averaged quantity per fluid cell which is larger than a single particle. Information on the porosity must be provided by either experimental techniques or particle based methods such as the discrete element method (DEM). The DEM can be coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a combined DEM–CFD approach and is then applicable to systems involving arbitrary shaped particles. As flow is not resolved in porous approaches information on the pressure drop must be provided by suitable submodels e.g. the combination of the drag force model by Di Felice (Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 20 (1994) 153–159 [1]) and the drag coefficient model by Hölzer and Sommerfeld (Powder Technol. 184 (2008) 361–365 [2]). As there is an ongoing discussion regarding the validity of these combined submodels, pressure drops in packings of spherical and non-spherical particles are derived by carefully performed experimental investigations as a verification. Numerically obtained results from the DEM–CFD are benchmarked against the experiments and available empirical correlations for the pressure drop. Results are in very good agreement for spheres. For complex shaped particles DEM–CFD simulations can be very flexibly applied. Simulations are generally in good agreement with experiments depending on the particle shape and size and are often better than empirical correlations which are usually tailored towards certain shapes and therefore limited in their usability.},

In industry, fluidization of particles featuring a wide range of shapes is common in various applications such as biomass gasification, drying applications, food processing and production of pharmaceuticals. Earlier publications have mainly focused on segregation of spherical particles of different volume or density. The particles used in this study have equal volume and density but a different shape. The main purpose of this work is to study de-mixing driven by particle shape.
To analyze the particle distributions inside the fluidized bed, a Digital Image Analysis (DIA) technique has been developed, capable of capturing the particle positions and orientations within the bed over time. The experiments show that in the non-bubbling flow regime (at low fluidization velocities) rod-shaped particles may segregate, sinking to the bottom of the bed. In the bubbling flow regime (at higher fluidization velocities) segregation does not occur, because of bubble-induced mixing. Here strong alignment of the cylindrical particle's long axis with the flow is observed. The experimental results obtained give qualitative and quantitative insight in the behavior of non-spherical particles in fluidized beds and can be used for validation of numerical models concerning non-spherical particle mixing.},
