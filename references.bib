Nusselt group upon Reynolds number. The expression is extended to describe mass

to a Reynolds number of 105.}

A Monte Carlo technique is used to simulate the energy bundle traveling through the voids of the bed. The randomly packed bed is assumed to be an absorbing-scattering medium with effective absorption and scattering coefficients. The packing pattern is modeled by a numerical simulation of rigid spheres slowly settling into a randomly packed assemblage. The Monte Carlo simulation of radiant energy transport through the packed beds generates the transmission curve as a function of bed height and sphere emissivity. The effective absorption and scattering coefficients of the randomly packed bed are evaluated by using the solution of the two-flux equations and Monte Carlo transmission results. Results show a strong dependence of the thermal radiative properties on the packing structure and the size and emissivity of constitutent spheres. Qualitative agreement is shown in comparison with other work which used regular cubic packing, and with existing experimental data.},

  abstract  = {Based on the understanding of existing spatial digital tree-based contact detection approaches, and the alternating digital tree (ADT) algorithm in particular, a more efficient algorithm, termed the augmented spatial digital tree (ASDT) algorithm, is proposed in the present work. The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower corner vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper corner vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT. The numerical results indicate that the ASDT is, at least, over 3.9 times faster than the ADT.},

examine heat conduction through static, two-dimensional beds of granular
materials. Results of both experiments and a microstructurally based continuum
model compare well with those obtained from TPD simulation. The TPD technique,
therefore, may provide a unique test-bed for validating or extending theories of
effective properties in granular media by yielding detailed mechanical and
thermal information not easily measured in experiments. Moreover, in testing
this technique it is found that, at low compressive loads or in high aspect
ratio beds, the conductivity of particulate materials becomes highly
anisotropic. This suggests that it is possible to dynamically tune the granular
microstructure and hence the bed's properties.},

abstract = {Particle science and technology is a rapidly developing
interdisciplinary research area with its core being the understanding of the
relationships between micro- and macroscopic properties of particulate/granular
matter - a state of matter that is widely encountered but poorly understood. The
macroscopic behaviour of particulate matter is controlled by the interactions
between individual particles as well as interactions with surrounding fluids.
Understanding the microscopic mechanisms in terms of these interaction forces is
therefore key to leading to truly interdisciplinary research into particulate
matter and producing results that can be generally used. This aim can be
effectively achieved via particle scale research based on detailed microdynamic
information such as the forces acting on and trajectories of individual
particles in a considered system. In recent years, such research has been
rapidly developed worldwide, mainly as a result of the rapid development of
discrete particle simulation technique and computer technology. This paper
reviews the work in this area with special reference to the discrete element
method and associated theoretical developments. It covers three important
aspects: models for the calculation of the particle–particle and particle–fluid
interaction forces, coupling of discrete element method with computational fluid
dynamics to describe particle–fluid flow, and the theories for linking discrete
to continuum modelling. Needs for future development are also discussed.}

abstract = {This chapter deals with coal gasification, which is a process that
converts carbonaceous materials, such as coal, petroleum, petroleum coke, or
biomass, into carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Coal gasification as a
power-generation technology is gaining popularity due to the ready global
availability of the raw material (coal), as well as positive environmental
issues associated with this technology over other combustion technologies. To
ensure optimal process efficiency, an in-depth understanding of the coal
properties influencing gasification behavior is required. Gasification
performance is dependent on coal type and gasifier configuration. Typically,
gasifiers are classified according to the type of reactor used and the way in
which fuels and oxidant flow. The choice of gasification technology is dependent
on a variety of factors, but coal type is generally the least flexible factor
and gasification technology selection is typically based on the coal to be
processed.},

abstract = {Understanding and modelling the dynamic behavior of particulate
systems has been a major research focus worldwide for many years. Discrete
particle simulation plays an important role in this area. This technique can
provide dynamic information, such as the trajectories of and transient forces
acting on individual particles, which is difficult to obtain by the conventional
experimental techniques. Consequently, it has been increasingly used by various
investigators for different particulate processes. In spite of the large bulk
volume, little effort has been made to comprehensively review and summarize the
progress made in the past. To overcome this gap, we have recently completed a
review of the major work in this area in two separate parts. The first part has
been published [Zhu, H.P., Zhou, Z.Y., Yang, R.Y., Yu, A.B., 2007. Discrete
particle simulation of particulate systems: theoretical developments. Chemical
Engineering Science 62, 3378–3392.], which reviews the major theoretical
developments. This paper is the second one, aiming to provide a summary of the
studies based on discrete particle simulation in the past two decades or so. The
studies are categorized into three subject areas: particle packing, particle
flow, and particle–fluid flow. The major findings are discussed, with emphasis
on the microdynamics including packing/flow structure and particle–particle,
particle–fluid and particle–wall interaction forces. It is concluded that
discrete particle simulation is an effective method for particle scale research
of particulate matter. The needs for future research are also discussed.}

  abstract  = {The approach of combined discrete particle simulation (DPS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which has been increasingly applied to the modeling of particle-fluid flow, is extended to study particle-particle and particle-fluid heat transfer in packed and bubbling fluidized beds at an individual particle scale. The development of this model is described first, involving three heat transfer mechanisms: fluid-particle convection, particle-particle conduction and particle radiation. The model is then validated by comparing the predicted results with those measured in the literature in terms of bed effective thermal conductivity and individual particle heat transfer characteristics. The contribution of each of the three heat transfer mechanisms is quantified and analyzed. The results confirm that under certain conditions, individual particle heat transfer coefficient (HTC) can be constant in a fluidized bed, independent of gas superficial velocities. However, the relationship between HTC and gas superficial velocity varies with flow conditions and material properties such as thermal conductivities. The effectiveness and possible limitation of the hot sphere approach recently used in the experimental studies of heat transfer in fluidized beds are discussed. The results show that the proposed model offers an effective method to elucidate the mechanisms governing the heat transfer in packed and bubbling fluidized beds at a particle scale. The need for further development in this area is also discussed.},

In this paper we focus on particle flows in which the particles have no liquid films and report on an improved expression we have developed for the collision damping time of particle velocity fluctuations used in the BGK approximation. The improved expression includes the effects on the collision damping time of the particle material coefficient of restitution and of non-equilibrium particle velocity distributions. The collision model improvements are incorporated into the general-purpose computational-particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) numerical methodology for dense particle flows. Three computational examples show the benefits of using the new collision time in calculations of particle separation in polydisperse dense particle flows and calculations of colliding particle jets.},

We derive a scaling law for a linear-spring dashpot interaction model that enables tracking of clouds of particles through DEM-based simulation of (scaled) pseudo-particles. This guarantees convergence to a DEM-based simulation of the unscaled system, i.e., a system where
all the individual particles are tracked. We use a BGK-like relaxation term to model collisions between particles in dilute regions of the flow field. This combined approach is implemented in an in-house code that runs on GPUs (Radeke et al., 2010), and is used to study a granular jet impinging on a plane surface, as well as a simple shear flow. We find that a BGK-type relaxation model is necessary when using parcel-based approaches for capturing some prominent flow features.},

Therefore, an efficient algorithm for ray-object intersection in complex geometries may cause saving time and computational effort. This paper presents a new ray-object intersection algorithm based on the well-known simplex method from linear programming. This algorithm works by searching a point in the feasible region which is defined by a set of plane equations of enclosure boundaries that maximize the line equation of the emitted energy bundle as the objective function. This algorithm is examined for two benchmark problems, namely two parallel plates with gray specular surfaces and a box with gray diffuse walls both in three-dimensional case. Although the computation time of the new proposed method is a bit higher than the conventional time, it is easy to implement because simplex algorithm is readily available as separate module in most programming languages. By using this algorithm number of objects which must be checked in complex geometries will be reduced considerably.},

abstract = {Understanding the details of the mixing and stoking process on grate firing systems is crucial for the optimization of the combustion process in waste or biomass incineration plants. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) can help to obtain further information on the mixing process within a bed of fuel particles. Especially the influence of a change in operational parameters can be examined avoiding large experimental effort. In the current paper five simulations for a generic grate are compared with the corresponding experiments. The experiments were carried out throughout an anterior parameter study on mixing and stoking on a grate [Sudbrock F.; Simsek E.; Wirtz S.; Scherer V.: “An experimental analysis of the influence of operational parameters on mixing and stoking of a monodisperse granulate on a grate”, Powder Technology 198, Issue 1, 29–37, 2010] [19]. The system considered is equipped with vertically moving bars which induce stoking. In a first approach monodisperse plastic spheres are used. The grate is encased by a transparent polycarbonate housing which provides optical access to the movement of the particles in the wall planes. The mixing process is measured and quantified by image analysis of the front wall of the grate. The mixing behaviour of the particle assembly observed in experiments and simulation appears to be very similar indicating that DEM is able to predict the particle mixing in the bed. In order to quantify the visual observations the mixing behaviour has been evaluated by different mixing parameters. They are compared in dependence of the number of strokes of the grate bars. A good agreement between measurements and simulations could be observed.},

provides a simple integral to numerically compute the exact value of the view
factor between two unit spheres without a blockage, but also plays a fundamental
role in improving the computed shaded view factor between two spheres subject to
any blockage. The product Fibonacci integration scheme, essentially a
ray-tracing method, appears to be a low cost but sufficiently accurate cubature
for evaluating the dual-integral defining the view factor. The use of a
particular non-uniform scaling function very favourably modulates the properties
of the view factor integrals, and thus substantially improves the solution
accuracy of the Fibonacci integration scheme. Several practical issues
associated with the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are discussed, and
test cases are provided to illustrate the applicability of the procedure.},

a combination of finite element methods (where the geometry in question is
sub-divided into a large number of uniform, often triangular, elements) and
Monte Carlo Ray Tracing (MC-RT) has been developed, although frequently the
software implementation is suitable only for a limited set of geometrical
scenarios. Driven initially by a need to calculate the radiative heat transfer
occurring within an operational fibre-drawing furnace, this research set out to
examine options whereby MC-RT could be used to cost-effectively calculate any

started to solve some of the complex problems in comminution. This review
article provides a general, though not exhaustive, overview of the application
of computational techniques to the science of comminution. Over the last two
decades the DEM has become an important tool for understanding comminution
fundamentals and providing information for the design, optimisation and
operation of comminution devices. Over that time, the application of DEM in
simulating fracture, breakage, crushing, milling and equipment wear has
increased in size and complexity. Information from DEM has contributed to
modelling techniques like, mechanistic modelling, the Unified Comminution Model
and the Virtual Comminution Machine. These have enabled step changes in
understanding of comminution processes. DEM is now widely used in industries
where comminution is critical. Important challenges remain for the next decade
including representation of unresolved fine material: prediction of its
influence on the overall processes and its size reduction. Similarly, slurry
phase transport and rheology have barely been touched on in using computational
techniques in comminution modelling. Most importantly in the future is the
uptake of the DEM outputs into standard comminution models used in design and
optimisation of equipment and processes, as despite the progress made in
understanding and in quantitative outputs the barriers to routine uptake have

It was found that there is a critical cell size (3.82 particle diameters) beyond which the PCM can achieve the same numerical stability and prediction accuracy as those of the analytical approach. There is also a critical cell size (1/19.3 domain size) below which meso-scale flow structures are resolved. Moreover, a lower limit of cell size (1.63 particle diameters) was identified to satisfy the assumptions of CFD-DEM governing equations. A reference map for selecting the ideal computational cell size and the suitable approach for void fraction calculation was subsequently developed.},

observed in such cases. The ship motion response shows strong sensitivity to
incident wave steepness, especially around the natural frequencies for ship
motion and sloshing motion respectively. Besides, no impact behavior in sloshing
pressure and moment signals is observed when the incident wave is close to
natural frequency of ship motion. Instead, impact phenomena can be observed only
when the incident wave is close to sloshing natural frequency. However, the
steady-state ship motion response is still found to be almost linear and
sinusoidal at that wave frequency. The higher-order harmonics of the sloshing
moment are filtered out by the system. The sloshing impact loading has no

abstract = {Unstructured packings consisting of arbitrary shaped particles are widely used in chemical, biochemical and petrochemical industries as well as in energy technology. In packings passed through by a fluid, pressure drops are of key concern and can be derived experimentally, calculated by empirical correlations or by numerical approaches. Among numerical approaches either resolved flow simulations or porous approaches are feasible. In the latter approach large systems can be addressed at reasonable computational expense. The fluid velocity is addressed as a spatially averaged quantity per fluid cell which is larger than a single particle. Information on the porosity must be provided by either experimental techniques or particle based methods such as the discrete element method (DEM). The DEM can be coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to a combined DEM–CFD approach and is then applicable to systems involving arbitrary shaped particles. As flow is not resolved in porous approaches information on the pressure drop must be provided by suitable submodels e.g. the combination of the drag force model by Di Felice (Int. J. Multiph. Flow. 20 (1994) 153–159 [1]) and the drag coefficient model by Hölzer and Sommerfeld (Powder Technol. 184 (2008) 361–365 [2]). As there is an ongoing discussion regarding the validity of these combined submodels, pressure drops in packings of spherical and non-spherical particles are derived by carefully performed experimental investigations as a verification. Numerically obtained results from the DEM–CFD are benchmarked against the experiments and available empirical correlations for the pressure drop. Results are in very good agreement for spheres. For complex shaped particles DEM–CFD simulations can be very flexibly applied. Simulations are generally in good agreement with experiments depending on the particle shape and size and are often better than empirical correlations which are usually tailored towards certain shapes and therefore limited in their usability.},

abstract = {A fundamental understanding of the underlying physics of granular
(particulate) systems is not only of academic interest, but is also highly
relevant for industrial applications. Nowadays computational techniques, e.g.
the discrete element method (DEM), are frequently applied as a tool to probe the
behavior of granular systems. The DEM is a particularly attractive modelling
technique since it can provide both macroscopic and microscopic ‘measurements’
in granular systems and allows particles of non-spherical shape to be modelled.
This ability is important since there is a common understanding that particle
shape has a strong influence on the dynamics of these systems. Here, we
critically review recent developments in DEM to model particles of non-spherical
shape. The first section of the review is concerned with advances in the
formulation and implementation of non-spherical particle models, including shape
representation, algorithms for the efficient detection of contacts and the
determination of contact parameters. In the second part, we review the main
findings obtained from numerical ‘measurements’ in granular systems containing
non-spherical particles using the DEM. The systems covered in this review
include the packing of particles, particle flow (e.g. plane shear flow, the
discharge of particles from hoppers and particle motion in vibrated beds and
rotating cylinders) and two-phase particle flows such as gas–solid fluidized
beds and pneumatic conveying. We conclude with an outlook highlighting the
future research needed to further advance this promising modelling technique.},

abstract = {The theoretical description of fuel conversion processes and the
numerical simulation of the equipment employed has gained considerable
industrial application throughout the last two decades. Starting from the
combustion of gaseous fuel in homogeneous turbulent flows, a basically
continuous, Eulerian fluid, the further development lead to the Lagrangian
description of droplets or pulverized solid fuel particles by independently
tracking there movement and conversion within the fluid and neglecting
collisions. Current developments in the energy sector require the consideration
of much larger particles which can no longer be considered as non-colliding
material points. Municipal waste incineration on grates [1], directly or
indirectly heated rotary kilns [2] or wood pellet combustion in domestic boilers
are such examples, where the Discrete Element Method (DEM) extends the
Lagrangian description to a mechanically and thermally fully interacting flow of
reacting granular material. In some situations with sufficiently large scale
differences distinctive interfaces can be identified between the conventional
CFD-description and the solid bed, thus allowing a separate and different
treatment of radiation in both regions. In other applications like in shaft
kilns, the radiative transfer within the moving bed enhances the effective
conductivity of the porous medium. Available commercial CFD-Codes provide
several different radiation models suitable for grey or non-grey media enclosed
by walls. They range from approaches fully neglecting interaction with the
enclosed gas phase (S2S), models describing the radiative transfer solely as a
diffusive process (P-1), directionally discretised radiative transport equations
as in the Discrete Ordinates (DO) method up to techniques explicitly relying on
rays passing through the participating media (Discrete Transfer, DTRM). The
integration of any of these radiation models into a coupled CFD-DEM code
represents a challenge and is even more complex if a distinctive separating
surface does not exist. In the work presented, the significance of using
adequate modelling of the radiative fluxes onto the surface of reacting granular
media will be discussed in the context of two technical relevant examples, the
waste conversion on reciprocating grates in municipal waste incinerators and
heat the exchange with the moving material surface in rotating kilns. The
restrictions and pitfalls in modifications of the boundary conditions for the
different radiation models will be discussed and compared with each other.}

To validate the drag force model and to learn more about the fluidization behavior of non-spherical particles the pressure drop, particle height and orientation distributions were analyzed. To gain comparable data from the experiments, a PTV-MATLAB script was developed to detect particles and determine their orientations and heights. Experimental and numerical results are in good agreement for most particle types; differences in the pressure drop can be allocated to mismatching particle heights or orientations. Differences in the particle height distribution are a result of particles that stack up in corners or close to the vessel walls. It was found that despite these local deviations the DEM–CFD can accurately reproduce the orientation behavior of elongated particles, which with increasing velocity align themselves with the flow. For elongated particles below a certain elongation ratio this behavior could not be observed, which was confirmed by both experiments and simulations.},

abstract = {The modeling of radiative heat transfer in complex radiant enclosures is a particularly challenging subject. This simulation is often best treated by calculating distribution factors through the Monte Carlo method. In order to enhance performance of the Monte Carlo method, efficient algorithms to find location of emission and direction of emission in the original Monte Carlo method are implemented. Next, the best ray tracing algorithm is introduced by comparing timing results of the USD, the BSP, the Simplex and the VVA acceleration ray tracing algorithms to make it numerically efficient as possible. Also, the constrained maximum likelihood estimation is used to enhance accuracy of the Monte Carlo by smoothing inherent random errors in the estimated distribution factors to simultaneously satisfy both of the reciprocity and summation rules. Accuracy of the Monte Carlo method is tested for a classical problem, namely a 3D box, with diffuse gray walls. For efficiency study, the optimized Monte Carlo method is then tested for two real radiative enclosures with convex and concave geometries. All ray tracing algorithms are found to result in computational gains, with respect to direct calculations that do not employ any acceleration technique. In the considered test cases, the VVA and the USD algorithms are found to be clearly superior to the BSP and the Simplex algorithms, particularly for concave geometries that have some obstructions within the computational domain.},

transport devices, such as pebble-bed high temperature gas-cooled nuclear
reactors (HTGR). The effect of particle thermal radiation in packed pebble beds
has been rarely investigated at particle scale. In this work, a complete CFD-DEM
method coupled with particle-scale radiation is discussed for packed pebble
beds, considering particle motion, fluid flow, particle-fluid interactions and
heat convection, conduction and particle radiation. It is shown that, compared
to the case without particle radiation, heat transfer is enhanced greatly by
particle radiation at high temperatures. A particle radiation factor (PRF) is
proposed as an independent non-dimensional parameter to qualify the effect of
particle-scale radiation in packed pebble beds. The PRF increases significantly
with temperature and decreases gradually as the heat storage capacity or the
thermal conductivity of the fluid increases. A demonstrative utilization of the
present model is performed for a benchmark problem based on the HTR-10 nuclear
reactor, and the results in general are in agreement with the results predicted
by other empirical codes. When the nuclear reactor is above full power, the
power required by the fan will increase significantly. In the decay heat removal
process, particle radiation is essential to keep the bed temperature below the
allowable limit, which is significant for nuclear reactor safety.}

In industry, fluidization of particles featuring a wide range of shapes is common in various applications such as biomass gasification, drying applications, food processing and production of pharmaceuticals. Earlier publications have mainly focused on segregation of spherical particles of different volume or density. The particles used in this study have equal volume and density but a different shape. The main purpose of this work is to study de-mixing driven by particle shape.
To analyze the particle distributions inside the fluidized bed, a Digital Image Analysis (DIA) technique has been developed, capable of capturing the particle positions and orientations within the bed over time. The experiments show that in the non-bubbling flow regime (at low fluidization velocities) rod-shaped particles may segregate, sinking to the bottom of the bed. In the bubbling flow regime (at higher fluidization velocities) segregation does not occur, because of bubble-induced mixing. Here strong alignment of the cylindrical particle's long axis with the flow is observed. The experimental results obtained give qualitative and quantitative insight in the behavior of non-spherical particles in fluidized beds and can be used for validation of numerical models concerning non-spherical particle mixing.},

LIGGGHTS, a solver for the DEM. A combination of LIGGGHTS and a solver for
intra-particle temperature gradients, i.e., ParScale, is then used to quantify
the relevance of radiative heat transfer rates in sheared particles beds.
Specifically, we evaluate the relative contributions of conductive, convective

spheres. We find that the radiative flux can be collapsed onto single curve if
it is related to an appropriate dimensionless group. Our analysis establishes a
rationale on when radiative heat transfer in dense granular flows should be

Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations were run to find view factors between particles in packed beds, and correlations were found to estimate both particle-particle and particle-wall radiation view factors based on distance alone. The correlations can be readily implemented into any CFD-DEM code to model radiation heat transfer, which is demonstrated using the LIGGGHTS-OpenFOAM-CFDEM software combination. With the addition of the radiation models described, all relevant heat transfer modes in a dense particle flow can now accounted for, and LIGGGHTS-OpenFOAM-CFDEM can be used to model particle-based solar receivers and heat exchangers at high temperature.},

  abstract  = {Radiation can play a central role in turbulent reactive flows where heat
transfer is enhanced in applications with high temperature and pressure. The
Monte Carlo method is a successful technique to solve the radiative transfer
equation accurately with relative ease while retaining detailed properties.
However, its drawback is associated to a slow convergence rate. One strategy to
improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo method consists in replacing the
pseudo-random sequences with an alternative sampling: the low-discrepancy
sequences. The introduction of such sequences in Monte Carlo leads to
Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. Their advantage lies in a higher convergence rate
compared to MC methods which have however not been assessed in 3D participating
media. Additionally, in order to get an error estimation which is necessary in
practical applications, a randomization of Quasi-Monte Carlo is needed
(Randomized-QMC). Such Randomized-QMC methods have not been considered for
simulations of radiative heat transfer in participating media before. In the
present study, Monte Carlo and Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo methods are assessed
in terms of efficiency and computational cost in radiative heat transfer
simulations of three practical 3D configurations. Comparisons in terms of local
standard deviation, convergence rate, and final computational cost show that
Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo outperforms Monte Carlo in all the investigated
cases.},

  abstract  = {Process simulation using mathematical modeling tools is becoming more common in the pharmaceutical industry. A mechanistic model is a mathematical modeling tool that can enhance process understanding, reduce experimentation cost and improve product quality. A commonly used mechanistic modeling approach for powder is the discrete element method (DEM). Most pharmaceutical materials have powder or granular material. Therefore, DEM might be widely applied in the pharmaceutical industry. This review focused on the basic elements of DEM and its implementations in pharmaceutical manufacturing simulation. Contact models and input parameters are essential elements in DEM simulation. Contact models computed contact forces acting on the particle-particle and particle-geometry interactions. Input parameters were divided into two types - material properties and interaction parameters. Various calibration methods were presented to define the interaction parameters of pharmaceutical materials. Several applications of DEM simulation in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, such as milling, blending, granulation and coating, were categorized and summarized. Based on this review, DEM simulation might provide a systematic process understanding and process control to ensure the quality of a drug product.},

Unlike most previous studies, the method does not rely on the assumption of a unit cell or absorption and scattering coefficients to derive k_rad . In this method, radiation is modeled with a 3D Monte Carlo ray tracing code, steady state particle temperatures are found with a particle-particle heat exchange simulation, and k_rad is found with a comparison to heat conduction in an isotropic solid of the same geometry. This leads to the dimensionless Exchange Factor (F_E), allowing k_rad to be calculated at any temperature and particle radius. The key result is a model for F_E over the entire range of emissivities from 0.3 to 1 and solid fractions from 0.25 to the fully packed state of 0.64. F_E results are compared to previous models, with agreement shown in some cases but a large disagreement found for low solid fractions. The k_rad results are combined with the Zehner and Schlünder model for solid and fluid conduction, providing an equation for the full effective thermal conductivity.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, DEM-based simulation has become a promising
alternative to physical measurements of thermal particulate systems. Despite
their rapid advancement and successful applications to a wide range of
industrial processes, a comprehensive review of the theory that underpins the
thermal DEM-based simulations is yet to be conducted. This work presents a
critical and in-depth review of all major thermal models and heat transfer
mechanisms pertinent to DEM-based simulations. Other critical aspects such as
boundary conditions and particle body temperature distribution that were often
overlooked are also summarized and discussed, aiming to provide a clear path for
the development of robust thermal DEM-based models.

The quasi-analytical solution based on the Hertzian contact theory proves
classic and remains the main method to solving the conduction of static
contacts. Recent attempts have been mainly directed towards improving the
calculation of conduction through collisional contacts and the thin wedge of
interstitial fluid between particles. Empirical correlations that were developed
before 1981 remain predominant in calculating the fluid-particle convection
coefficient. Though more accurate, the discrete models of radiation that rely on
the solution of view factors amongst individual particles have been applied much
less than the continuum models due to the significant computational overhead.
Generally, previous efforts have led to the construction of a solid framework of
thermal DEM-based models. Significant work is required to improve existing or
develop new heat transfer sub-models, particularly those for accurate and
efficient modelling of conduction and radiation in particle-laden systems.},

The key question asked is “Is the ever-popular Monte-Carlo method combined with ray tracing the best approach for evaluating view factors?”. For two of the view factor configurations a Monte-Carlo method and quasi-Monte-Carlo method based on the numerical integration of the view factor integral are much more accurate than a Monte-Carlo method and quasi-Monte-Carlo method based on ray tracing. An interesting conclusion is that when ray tracing is inefficient, i.e., the view factor is small, numerical integration works very well, exactly when ray tracing has poor accuracy.
For the third view factor where the two surfaces have a common edge the view factor integral has a singularity at the common edge and ray tracing works well relative to numerical integration. A new hybrid Monte-Carlo method and quasi-Monte-Carlo method that combines the advantages of ray tracing and numerical integration for the view factor configuration with a common edge is presented. The hybrid quasi-Monte-Carlo method is shown to be the most efficient method of evaluating the view factor integral.},

However, challenges arise from conflicting requirements regarding the CFD grid size, which must adequately resolve fluid flow in the pore space while maintaining a physically meaningful porosity field. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a two-grid mapping approach. Initially, the porosity field associated with fine particles is estimated using a coarse CFD grid, which is then mapped to a dynamically refined grid. To ensure conservation of total solid volume, a volume compensation procedure is implemented. The proposed method has been rigorously verified using benchmark cases, showing its high computational efficiency and accurate handling of complex porosity calculations near the surface of coarse particles. Moreover, the previously unreported impact of the empirical drag correlation on fluid-particle force calculations for both coarse and fine particles has been revealed.},

Radiation distribution factor (RD) and its extension to continuum scale, radiation distribution function (RDF), are basic parameters to calculate radiative heat transfer in particulate media, which contain both the information of geometrical arrangement and radiative properties of particles. They can fully characterize radiative heat transfer characteristics in a particulate system. Yet the distribution law of RDF is still not well established. In this paper, the analytical relation of RDF in a randomly and uniformly distributed particulate system is extended to account for highly multiple scattering effects. A double average treatment is used to obtain the statistically averaged RD distribution. Radiative heat transfer simulations are carried out to verify the performance of the analytical RDF relation. The relative errors between the results based on analytical relation and discrete RD data are around 1%. Model parameters of the analytical RDF relation for a wide range of particle solid fractions and surface emissivities are obtained. This work deepens the understanding of RDF characteristics and the presented analytical relation provides a reference for industrial analysis of radiative heat transfer in dense particulate systems.},

The details of the flow near the particle surface are therefore not fully resolved. When the particle scale is larger than the resolved flow scale, the coupling between the CFD model and the DEM model is critical. An effective coupling scheme should minimize the risk of artificial influences on the results from choices of numerical parameters in implementations and consider efficiency and robustness. In this work, a novel coupling method is developed. The method includes both the smoothing of the particle data and the sampling of the gas phase quantities. The smoothing employs the diffusion-based method. The gas sampling method can reconstruct the filtered fluid quantities at the particle center. The sampling method is developed based on the diffusion-based method with higher efficiency. The new method avoids mesh searching and it can be easily implemented in parallel computing. The developed method is validated by the simulation of a forced convection experiment for a fixed bed with steel spheres. With the well-posed grid-independent coupling scheme, the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The coupling effects and the computational cost are discussed in detail.},

The current study is focused on concentrating solar power receivers which use solid particles as a heat transfer medium, but results are applicable to particle beds in various industries. The analyses are carried out using a purpose-built open-source Monte Carlo Ray Tracing code for beam radiation striking a group of particles. Particle beds with a uniform solid fraction and diffuse reflections are studied first, with the total bed absorptivity found for various combinations of the incidence angle, absorptivity, and solid fraction, culminating in an expression for the total bed absorptivity as a function of these independent variables. In addition, the transmitted fraction of incident rays as a function of distance into the bed is given in table format for many sets of these parameters. These results form the foundation of an algorithm developed to estimate the radiation absorption at different depths in the more challenging case where the solid fraction varies as a function of depth in the bed. This is particularly important for the “CentRec” solar receiver, where the solid fraction oscillates due to the thin particle film used in this device (only 4–10 particle diameters thick), as well as the dynamic nature of the particle film. The algorithm is implemented in a Discrete Element Method model for heat transfer in the CentRec receiver, and the algorithm is shown to have a high accuracy with a very low computational cost compared to a full Monte Carlo Ray Tracing simulation.},

Before training and analyzing the predictive capability of each method, an adjustment of markers used in monodisperse systems, as well as an evaluation of new markers was performed. On the basis of our dataset that considers a wide range of particle radii ratios, system sizes, particle volume fractions, as well as different particle-species volume fractions, we found that (i) the addition of particle size information allows the transition from monodisperse to bi- and polydisperse beds, and (ii) the addition of particle volume fraction information as the fourth marker leads to very accurate predictions. In terms of the overall performance, DNNs and RFRs should be preferred compared to the other two options. For particleeparticle view factors, DNN and RFR are on par, while for particleewall the RFR is superior. We demonstrate that DNNs and RFRs can be built to meet or even exceed the prediction quality standards achieved in a monodisperse system.},

abstract = {A heater where particles fall under gravity and flow over a series
of hot angled surfaces is simulated. The conductive, convective, and interphase
heat transfer are simulated for all particles via discrete element modeling
(DEM). The heater inclination angle, particle-particle and particle-wall
friction coefficients, and thermal contact resistances are parametrically
varied. Decreasing the inclination angle increases the residence time and
overall heat transfer coefficient. Low values of the friction coefficients slow
the particles and increase heating, but moderate to high values of friction
dilute the flow and decrease the heat transfer. The contact resistance between
particles is difficult to accurately characterize, so a wide range is studied.
The contact resistance is altered by varying the particle roughness from 27.5 nm
to 1 um, which reduces the overall heat transfer coefficient by 25%. A reduced
order model is developed and validated to extrapolate the small-scale DEM
results to a larger-scale system.}

abstract = {The calculation of radiative heat transfer between particles in particle-based solar systems presents significant challenges in terms of computational cost and accuracy. This study addresses these challenges by employing the discrete element method to generate random particle packings and the Monte Carlo ray tracing method to investigate the influence of particle shape and volume fraction ($\phi$) on interparticle radiation transfer and the absorption of incident radiation. The results reveal that, at low volume fractions, the shape and orientation of ellipsoidal particles have a pronounced impact on direct radiative transfer. Oblate particles exhibit the highest average radiation distribution factor (RDF), and the dispersion of RDF data is more prominent for oblate and elongated prolate particles compared to spheres. As $\phi$ increases to 0.35, the contribution of indirect transfer from neighboring particles becomes significant for oblate particles, resulting in a reduction in the dispersion of RDF data. Furthermore, when $\phi$ reaches 0.55, the decisive factor in determining RDF becomes the shielding effect of particles positioned between the emitting and receiving particles. The average RDF tends to converge among particles of different shapes, although oblate and elongated prolate particles still exhibit considerably larger RDF dispersion compared to spherical and near-spherical particles. Additionally, the effective absorptivity of the particle bed for incident radiation decreases as the aspect ratio of particles increases at all volume fractions. Moreover, the transmitted fraction demonstrates an exponential relationship with the depth, and beds composed of spherical particles exhibit better radiation transmittance compared to beds containing non-spherical particles.},

  abstract  = {Based on the discrete element method (DEM) and GPU parallel computing, a particle heat transfer model is developed to simulate the heat transfer in a pebble bed of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). The model is implemented based on a previously developed GPU-DEM program by our team and uses the mesh-based neighbor searching algorithm for the heat transfer calculation. This model couples the conduction and radiative heat transfer between the pebbles and incorporates neural networks and empirical fittings to calculate the radiation view factors, which can improve computational efficiency. The effective thermal conductivity of different models and experimental data are used to verify the accuracy of the model, and the influence of different radiation heat transfer models on the results is also compared. The results show that the effective thermal conductivity derived from the current model is comparable to the classical models at different temperatures, and the numerical simulation results based on the current model are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. Additionally, the model achieves a single-core speedup ratio of 126–395 times with GPU acceleration, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. In conclusion, the current model has been effectively verified for accuracy and computational efficiency, and it demonstrates great potential in dealing with large-scale pebble flow and heat transfer challenges in HTGRs.},

  abstract  = {In the present paper, a fluid-particle coupling method is directly derived from the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) by applying the concept of volume-filtering, yielding a physically consistent methodology to incorporate solid wall boundary conditions in the volume-filtered flow solution, thereby allowing to solve the governing flow equations on non-body conforming meshes. The resulting methodology possesses similarities with a continuous forcing immersed boundary method (IBM) and is, therefore, termed physically consistent IBM (PC-IBM). Based on the recent findings of Hausmann et al. [1], the closures arising in the volume-filtered NSE are closed by suitable models or even expressed analytically. The PC-IBM is fully compatible with the large eddy simulation framework, as the volume-filtered NSE converge to the filtered NSE away from solid boundaries. The potential of the PC-IBM is demonstrated by means of different particle-laden flow applications, including a dense packing of fixed particles and periodic settling of 500 particles. The new methodology turns out to be capable of accurately predicting the fluid forces on particles with relatively coarse mesh resolutions. For the flow around isolated spheres, a spatial resolution of six fluid mesh cells per diameter is sufficient to predict the drag force with less than 10% deviation from highly resolved simulation for the investigated particle Reynolds numbers ranging from 10 to 250.},

abstract = {Multi-phase flows in the presence of complex solid geometries are encountered widely throughout industrial processes to intensify mass and heat transfer processes. The efficiency of these processes relies largely on the predominant fluid dynamics regime inside the reaction vessel (e.g. trickle bed, bubble column reactor). The prevailing flow structure is influenced by many factors including the nature of the fluid-solid interactions (i.e. wetting or non-wetting). Such flows are often studied using front-capturing techniques to capture the fluid-fluid interface in combination with an auxiliary model to account for fluid-solid interactions. However, these front-capturing methods have difficulties in accurately representing the interface. Therefore, we adopted a front-tracking method: the Local Front Reconstruction Method (LFRM). In this study, LFRM is coupled with the Immersed Boundary method to incorporate the no-slip boundary condition at the solid surface. The model performance is assessed using droplet spreading simulations, where the equilibrium droplet shape (i.e. radius, height, and outline), the interfacial pressure difference, and the surface tension force are compared to analytical solutions and literature data. The results show an excellent match with the analytical solutions, and additionally superior performance to state-of-the-art volume tracking models.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we use a combined CFD-Discrete Element Method to assess predictive capabilities and numerical implications of a coarse-graining technique in Wurster fluidised-bed coaters. We investigated both hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer and conducted simulations of a full three-phase system for the original and three coarse-grained systems, analysing velocity distributions, macroscopic solid stresses, moisture content and phase temperatures. We achieved a logarithmic simulation speed-up by aggregating up to 64 original particles into each coarse grain. This was accomplished while maintaining fidelity to the original CFD-DEM system in terms of reproducing with high accuracy macroscopic granular flow properties in different regions of a coater (drying, tube and bed regions). By integrating a liquid spray and humid air, we demonstrated that the phase temperatures were accurately predicted within the coarse-grained system, with a high capability of delivering liquid spray distributions with the same uniformity and drying. We also give arguments for choosing a certain degree of coarse-graining as a compromise between a desired reduction of computational costs and a trustworthy reproduction of granular-flow physics encountered in different regions of a Wurster bed. Our findings pave the way to using CFD-DEM to industrially-scaled Wurster-bed systems, which is currently unfeasible due to prohibitive computational costs.},
